# TaskTracker

A simple Angular application to keep track of tasks. It allows you to create, read, update and delete a task. 

## Getting started

Clone the repository into you local environment 
Open the cloned repo in your prefared IDE.
Run npm install to install dependencies.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Navigating the application 

Running the application will get you to that dashboard (localhost:4200/dashboard) 
The dashboard will display all tasks. 
Click on the "Add Task" button to open a modal where you can fill out the task details before click "save". 
Click on a specific task to view/read, update or delete a task.
You can filter through all tasks by a search query or the status of a task. 

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
